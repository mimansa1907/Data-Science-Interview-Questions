DP - applied in condition where 
1. choice
2. opitmal
is given

Uses 1. Memomiaztion(needs  only 2 extra lines) alternate 2. Top-Down
Memomiazation - just store each result

Knapsack (Bag)(Input- items)(Capcity of bag)(val,weight of items are given)(maximize profit)
1. Fractional - greedy (Items can be given in parts as well)
2. 0-1 bounded - item goes as a whole (Problem of DP) (TOP-DOWN APPROACH, prevents recursive call as it may cause stack overflow error)
3. Unbounded knapsack - Unlimited supply of each item is available

Apporach - Draw Recursive function -> make choice diagram -> base condition (think of smallest input n=, weight of knapsapck=0)


Recursive function - input gets smaller and smaller in size

Recursion convert to top-down dp

## F2F interview
1. 1 to N missing duplicate
2. Sliding window
3. Query Programming
4. Multi-pointers

## Sliding Window
1. Fix size - max/min value
2. Variable size - max/min window size

Problems:
Fixed size
1. Max min sub array of k
2. ist -ve number
3. Count occurence of anagram
4. Max of all subsarray of size k
5. Max and Min for every window size

Variable size
1. Largest smallest subaary sum k
2. largest substring k distinct character
3. length of largest substring no repear character
4. Pick toy
5. Mini. window substring
